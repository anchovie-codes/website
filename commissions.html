                    <p>great for 3d printing, laser engraving, PCB tracing, website assets, stickers, and so much more! vectors are infinitely scalable and easily converted into machine toolpaths. if you've ever wanted to slap your fursona's face on everything you own, this is a great start.</p>

                <p>when you commission me, you get everything: the final piece (in whatever formats needed) <strong>and all source files</strong>. i love seeing my work reused, repurposed, and modified. if you're a maker and want to alter or re-export a commission for future projects, i want to make that as easy as possible for you.</p>

                <p>rate: $30 USD per hour</p>
                <p>price estimates can be provided.</p>
                <p>for illustration, two revision cycles are included for free; the first upon receipt of an initial sketch, the second upon receipt of a finished sketch. after the sketch is approved, i will finish the piece. for other types of work, we can scope it out together and decide what's needed. communication is key. typically, subsequent revisions will incur additional charges equivalent to the hours needed to complete them.</p>
                <p>a watermarked lo-fi preview will be provided for final approval. payment is due upon approval in exchange for the final piece and all source files. i only accept paypal.</p>
                <p>if you want to individualize your commission as a unique, special piece that is yours alone while being visually-identical to clones i post online, i can encrypt a copy of your commission using <a href="https://github.com/anchovie-codes/not-NFT">not-NFT</a>, an eco-friendly and ultra-lightweight steganography tool (seriously, you can run it yourself, it's like 50 lines of code). this service is free of charge!</p>
                <p>work is done on a first come, first serve basis. i have a queue on <a target="_blank" href="https://trello.com/b/3es4UREm/anchovies-commission-queue">trello</a>.
                <p>art is my hobby. i work a full-time job during the week. completion times are dependent on my schedule. i don't accept rush jobs - zero exceptions.</p>
