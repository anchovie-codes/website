                <p>i can't make everything, but i can make a lot! check out the categories below to see what i've done in the past. alternatively, if you're already working on a project and need help, i love to collab.</p>

                    <p>great for 3d printing, laser engraving, PCB tracing, web assets, stickers, and so much more! vectors are infinitely scalable and easily converted into machine toolpaths. if you've ever wanted to slap your fursona's face on everything you own, this is a great start.</p>

                    <p>vector or raster, more technical art is my speciality. from geometric designs inspired by circuitry and mechanical forms to manga-style drift furries, i'll bring any idea to life.</p>

                <h2 style="padding: 0.5em;">//what do you get?</h2>
                <p>when you commission me, you get everything: the final piece (in whatever formats needed) <strong>and all source files</strong>. i love seeing my work reused, repurposed, and modified. if you're a maker and want to alter or re-export a commission for future projects, i want to make that as easy as possible for you.</p>
                <!--terms of service-->
                <h2 style="padding: 0.5em;">//terms of service</h2>
                <p>rate: $30 USD per hour</p>
                <p>i only accept paypal</p>
                <p>price estimates can be provided</p>
                <p>work is done on a first come, first serve basis. i have a queue on <a target="_blank" href="https://trello.com/b/3es4UREm/anchovies-commission-queue">trello</a>.

                <p>for illustration work, you can request revisions during the initial sketch. once the sketch is approved, i will finish the piece. subsequent revisions will cost extra for the hours needed to complete them.</p>
                <p>a watermarked lo-fi preview will be provided for final approval. payment is due in exchange for the final piece and all source files.</p>
                <p>if you want to individualize your commission from the visually-identical copies i post online, i can encrypt it with <a href="https://github.com/anchovie-codes/not-NFT">not-NFT</a>, an ultra-lightweight steganography tool (seriously, you can run it yourself, it's like 50 lines of code). this service is free of charge!</p>
                <p>art is my hobby. i work a full-time job during the week. completion times are dependent on my schedule. i don't accept rush jobs - zero exceptions.</p>
