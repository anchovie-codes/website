                    <p><strong>my name is anchovie!</strong> i have a questionable habit of collecting hobbies. this is a hub for all of them.</p>
                    <p>an inexhaustive list of <strong>things i do</strong>: art, design, cars, computers, rapid prototyping (3d printing, cnc, lasercutting), music, light coding, and keyboards.</p>
                    <p>i've been involved in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom" target="_blank">furry</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture" target="_blank">maker</a> communities for as long as i've had access to a computer at home. if i had to tie an age to my first encounter, i'd say i was about 10 years old. suffice to say, <strong>furries and technology have been with me for most of my life</strong>. many of my projects involve both; my most publicized being the now-defunct <a href="https://lapfoxtrax.fandom.com/wiki/Lapfox_Trax_Remix_Sound_Team" target="_blank">Lapfox Trax Remix Sound Team</a> (we were young and bad at music, but it was a good time). members of these communities have been foundational to what i do today, either directly as collaborators and mentors or indirectly as inspirers. i try to give back by logging my journeys publicly as those before me did. my hope is that  someday (maybe) something i do will light a spark in someone who stumbles upon it.</p>
                    <p>problem is, i'm generally <strong>pretty quiet in big spaces</strong>. i used to log my thoughts and projects  on twitter, but posting there made me anxious. to suit my preference for smaller environments i revived my <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/anchoviedraws" target="_blank">blog on tumblr</a>. if you want to hear my thoughts in real-time, consider following that. if you just want to see the finished results, follow this website's RSS feed or bookmark my URL and check in every now and then :3</p>
                    <p>all that being said, i love to chat with folks in smaller groups or individually. so if you wanna reach out - whether it's to talk shop, request a commission, show me your cool keyboard, or just say hi - <strong>don't be shy!</strong></p>
